BSCA Superheros Vue Project
Karsten Pease
Summer Part-Time 2017 Class

This is my first full-stack project

when we restart or start computer we *must* run :
  sudo mongod

  then leaving terminal/ command prompt window in which we run the command open.


You must leave the sudo monGod running while you are working on project.


This project requires fallowing node/npm packages:

-ExpressJS
-Body Parser
-Mongoose

and can be installed via command:
  npmm install --save express body-parser mongoose


  `If you are having touble commitign you need to commit projects not just SuperHeros Vue`
